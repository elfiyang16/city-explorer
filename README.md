We tend to use jQueryâ€™s Ajax (84 KB). If in a web application, we are adding jQuery to make only a few requests, then It is not at all bandwidth friendly. We are loading a script of 84kb to use only one or two methods. The problem can be solved using the Fetch API which is already present in our browser.
